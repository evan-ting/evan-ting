# Heyo everyone, I'm Evan! 

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Also the Team Lead of a software team in one of the papers I'm taking right now.

My dream is to be able to work with cool web technologies, while travelling around the world!

## Technologies I'm familiar with:

* Java
* Git
* Visual Studio Code 

## Technologies I've played around with:

* PlantUML
* Python
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## What I'm currently working on:

* The Odin Project's curriculum in web development, learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Reading Head First Design Patterns, learning about common methodologies to make code flexible and extensible.
* A blog page as my first project for my portfolio, using HTML and CSS 
* Advent of Code (though less often than the others listed above, especially now that I've solved most of the easier problems)
